# Auto_Outage_Email
Automated email system for network outages. Uses Google apps javascript

Typical usage scenario:

A NOC team member sees an important link go down. The team scrambles to find out what the issue is and resolve it - while reacting to customer calls, emails and the ticket creation process. What if the NOC team could handle a crisis in a more effecient manner?

This system allows the NOC team to write a text update of the issue and flood it to all affected customers, greatly reducing operational overhead during a link failure. This system allows consolidation of numerous customer tickets to a single Master ticket reducing administrative action and record keeping. This system allows quicker initial updates to customers increasing their satisfaction and improving their operational efficiency.
